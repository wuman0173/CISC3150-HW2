HW2-Question1

Comments: I cannot seem to understand how to create the mathematical logic behind the second half of the triangle in order to do what is desired.
I need to set each new line an integer starting from 1; to be incremented, but decreasing on the same line.

UPDATE: I had to play around with the numbers with tempsub and subtractor to make what was needed. I need to find out what is efficient, because I am sure this is not the best way to do it.
Does not have a proper format with pyramids with over 10 as base! Needs to be updated with more spaces to be nice looking.

		Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("How tall of a pyramid do you want to display on the screen?");
		
		int number = scan.nextInt();
		int subtractor = 1;
		int adder = 1;
		for (int i = 0; i < number; i++)
		{
			for (int j = 0; j < number-i-1; j++)
			{
				System.out.print("  ");
			}
			for(int k = number - i; k <= number; k++)
				{
				System.out.print(adder + " ");
				adder = adder + 1;
				}
			adder = 1;
			int tempsub = subtractor - 1; 		//Added this: sets tempsub to print out the first number of each line before the loop starts to decrement it.
			for(int k = number - i; k < number ; k++)
			{
				System.out.print(tempsub);	//Tried playing around with this...like -/+ subtractor, adder, number, tempsub
				tempsub = tempsub - 1;		//Within the loop, decrements it so it prints out counting downwards in the same line
			}
			subtractor = subtractor + 1;		//outside the Loop, increments the next line first number, so that tempsub gets the right number.
			System.out.print("\n");
