HW2-Question3

Comments: Used the String.charAt method to find palindrome. Set the first word, then make a new String and loop it backwards while placing it in the second string while using the charAt method.
Had some difficulties in setting the second string, such as first creating the string before putting anything in the string first, 
and looping it due to out of bounds exception.
